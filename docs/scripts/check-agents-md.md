# check-agents-md.mjs

Enforces the agent directive-file convention from `AGENTS.md`: directives are authored once, in `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` is a thin wrapper that imports them.

Maintaining `CLAUDE.md` as a full copy of `AGENTS.md` invites silent drift — the two files diverge and it is no longer clear which one Claude Code actually reads. This check makes `AGENTS.md` the single source of truth and `CLAUDE.md` a bare `@AGENTS.md` import, so there is exactly one place to edit and no copy to fall out of sync.

## Usage

```bash
node scripts/check-agents-md.mjs
pnpm run agents:validate
```

It runs in CI as the **Agent directive files** job in `.github/workflows/ci-actions.yml`, gated by the `detect-changes` job to run only when an `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` file (or this validator) changes — a closed-input check needs no run otherwise.

## What it checks

Walks the repository (skipping `.git`, `.git-worktrees`, `node_modules`, and build output), groups `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` files by directory, and for each directory asserts:

- **Pairing** — an `AGENTS.md` must have a companion `CLAUDE.md`, and a `CLAUDE.md` must have a companion `AGENTS.md`.
- **Bare wrapper** — a `CLAUDE.md` must contain only the single import line `@AGENTS.md` (blank lines aside); any other text is a violation.
- **No symlink** — a `CLAUDE.md` must be a real file, not a symlink to `AGENTS.md`.

Exits 0 when the whole tree is compliant; exits 1 with a `path: reason` line per violation.

## Requires

- `node` (walks the working tree only — no dependency install needed)

## Related

- [validate-docs.mjs](validate-docs.md), [validate-pins.mjs](validate-pins.md) — sibling standalone validators.
